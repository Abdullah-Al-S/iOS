* Tapping the pin will take you to a collection of photos related to the location you choosed before. If there is no photos for the choosen location,  a sentece saying **Pin has no photos** will be desplayed as the title of the collections. Or if you saw all the photos from that location, the sentece will be saying **No more photos**. Otherwise there will be no title for the page and photos will be presented.

* Tapping `< Back` button on the left corner of the page will take you back to the map. 
* Tapping `New Collection` button on the center buttom of the page will display a new collection of photos. 
* Tapping `Edit` on the top right corner will let you enter the _delete mode_. You will know that because you will see **Delete Mode** as the title of the page, the page color will change to dark gray color and instead of `Edit` you will see `Done`. In that mode when you select an image it will be emmidietly deleted. After you finish deleting unwanted photos, click `Done` to return to the normal mode.
